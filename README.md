# 📊 Customer Analytics & Prediction Dashboard  

End-to-end data science project for **Customer Churn Prediction, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Modeling, and Operational Analysis** using **SQL, Excel, Python, and Streamlit**.  

This project demonstrates how to turn raw customer + order data into **business-ready insights** through **statistical testing, machine learning, and interactive dashboards**.  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview  

- **Data Sources:**  
  - `customer_summary.csv` → demographics, loyalty, acquisition, campaigns, spend  
  - `order_summary.csv` → transactions, discounts, products, returns, interactions  

- **Objectives:**  
  ✅ Predict which customers will churn in the next 30 days  
  ✅ Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using probabilistic models  
  ✅ Perform operational/logistics analysis (returns, channels, campaigns)  
  ✅ Build a business-friendly **Streamlit dashboard** for visualization and decision-making
